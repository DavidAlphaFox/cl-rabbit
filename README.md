cl-rabbit - Common Lisp interface to RabbitMQ
=============================================

This library is a CFFI-based interface to the RabbitMQ client
libraries with an interface that is designed to be fairly close to the
native C API.

Note that this library is not complete, but basic stuff should work
without any issues.
